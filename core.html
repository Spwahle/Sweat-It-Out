              <li>Rise up on your toes so that only your forearms and toes touch the floor -- your body should hover a few inches off the floor in a straight line from shoulders to feet.</li>
              <li>Draw your navel toward your spine and tighten your buttocks. Look at the floor to keep your head in neutral position and breathe normally..</li>

            <li>Legs straight with toes high off the floor and with the arms on top of the bench holding on to the front edge.</li>
            <li>Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings and straighten the legs until they are level with the hips. This will be your starting position.</li>
            <li>Start the movement by lifting the left leg higher than the right leg.</li>
            <li>Then lower the left leg as you lift the right leg.</li>
            <li>Continue alternating in this manner (as though you are doing a flutter kick in water) until you have done the recommended amount of repetitions for each leg. Make sure that you keep a controlled movement at all times. Tip: You will breathe normally as you perform this movement.</li>

        <h2>Superman</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Lie face down. To begin, you need to lay flat on your stomach with your face towards the floor. When getting into position, keep your arms straight along your sides.</li>
          <li>Extend your arms. Extend both of your arms out in front of you. Keep your elbows slightly bent. Make sure to stretch your arms as far out as you can while still keeping your elbows bent and position your arms so that your palms are facing the floor.</li>
          <li>Lift your legs and arms. Lift your legs and arms off the ground as if you are flying. You want to keep your core in the stationary position. Make sure you lift your arms and legs simultaneously to maximize the effectiveness of the workout.</li>
          <li>Use your back muscles. You want to lift your chest up off the ground using your back muscles to keep your arms and legs elevated. Raise your chest so that your head is no more than 8 inches (20.3 cm)off the floor. Using these lower back muscles will help make them stronger and more flexible.</li>
          <li>Hold. Hold this position for one minute or two to five seconds per set, depending on how many sets you intend to do. Keep your body completely rigid and don’t relax your muscles at all. Holding the position is when your lower back muscles get their greatest work out.</li>
          <li>Release. After you’ve held this position for the predetermined amount of time, release it. You want to relax your muscles completely. This will give your muscles a break while also preparing them to undertake another set.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Boat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin seated with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hands resting beside your hips.</li>
        <li>Keeping your spine straight, lean back slightly and lift your feet, bringing your shins parallel to the floor.</li>
        <li>Draw in your low back, lift your chest, and lengthen the front of your torso. Then, extend your arms forward, in line with your shoulders with your palms facing each other.</li>
        <li>Balance on your sit bones, keeping your spine straight. Take care not to let your lower back sag or chest collapse.</li>
        <li>Lengthen the front of your torso from your pubic bone to the top of your sternum. The lower belly (the area below your navel) should be firm and somewhat flat, but not hard or thick.</li>
        <li>Spread your shoulder blades wide and reach out through your fingers, actively engaging your hands.</li>
        <!-- <li>Stay in the pose for five breaths, gradually working up to one minute. To release the pose, exhale as you lower your legs and hands to the floor.Pul</li> -->
