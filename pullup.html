            <h2>Basic Pullup</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.</li>
              <li>As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.</li>
              <li>Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.</li>
              <li>After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.</li>
              <li>Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Grab a pullup bar with a shoulder-width overhand grip, making sure your arms are completely straight and your feet are off the ground. This is your starting position.</li>
              <li>Brace your core and use your abs to raise your knees toward your shoulders. Pause when the tops of your thighs reach your chest. Return to the starting position.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Hang from a chin-up bar with both arms extended at arms length in top of you using either a wide grip or a medium grip. The legs should be straight down with the pelvis rolled slightly backwards. This will be your starting position.</li>
              <li>Raise your legs until the torso makes a 90-degree angle with the legs. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second or so.</li>
              <li>Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in.</li>
              <li>Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li>

              <li>Without any support other than your hands, simply try to hold your chin above the bar for as long as possible.</li>

              <li>Slowly lower yourself down, taking as much time as possible, into the dead hang position (arms fully extended).</li>
