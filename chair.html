                <li>Complete 15 steps leading with the left foot, then repeat another 15 steps leading with your left foot. Do three sets.</li>

              <li>Immediately bring your left foot back down to the ground, and alternate sides so you lift your left arm and tap the seat with your right toes.</li>
              <li>Continue to alternate taps as quickly as possible for 45 to 60 seconds, using your arms for momentum and balance.</li>

            <h2>Three Chair Pushups</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Arrange three chairs in a triangle. Your starting position is off the ground, with your feet elevated by one chair and your hands resting on the edges of the other two.</li>
              <li>Being further from the floor allows you to dip your body much lower than with a regular push-up, creating a wider range of shoulder movement.</li>
              <li>You can perform a similar push-up on the ground by resting both palms on a couple of large bricks on the floor. However, using chairs is a little tougher because your body is more parallel to the ground.</li>

            <li>Slowly descend to 90-degrees, as you would a regular lunge, then return to the upright position.  Complete all the reps on one leg before switching to the other.</li>
